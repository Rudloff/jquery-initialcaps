jQuery initialCaps
==================

jQuery initialCaps is a small jQuery plugin which can create the necessary markup
to create initial caps in a text.

# Getting started
You just have to link the main plugin file in your html document and initiate the
plugin with the script :
```js
$('.js-initial-caps').initialCaps();
```

`.js-initial-caps` is the class of the HTML container which contains all targeted
paragraphs.
